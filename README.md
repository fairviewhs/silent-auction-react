## Installing

*Silent auction* should work on any system that has `npm` and `node` installed. Once you clone the repo you must install the dependencies for the frontend and the backend.
They have separate package.json. In order to install go into `frontend` and run `npm install` and go into `backend` and run `npm install`.

### MongoDB

In order to run the backend you must have mongodb installed. Mongodb is a [no sql](https://medium.com/xplenty-blog/the-sql-vs-nosql-difference-mysql-vs-mongodb-32c9980e67b2) based database and stores it's data like json (which is easier for programmers to use).

To install mongodb go [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

Make sure you have the mongo database running by executing `mongo` in the terminal. `mongo` will connect you to the database.

### Configuration

Make sure that once you are ready to deploy the backend to heroku (or any server) that you have the environment variables already defined.
See [the config file](backend/src/config.ts) for information on which environment variables you need to define.

### Additional Information
